# TaxFormEFile
A .NET Standard library to encapsulate generating IRS e-filing document creation

## Vision
The vision for this project is to take [IRS Publication 1220](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1220.pdf) and with it, generate a .NET Standard Library which will encapsulate all of the logic necessary to generate an appropriately formatted e-file document which can be sent to the IRS at tax time.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the code here is not meant to replace your own work and verification processes and this project should not replace your own council with a CPA or other relevant support resources. In general, my focus will be upon 1099-MISC filing (as that is what I currently need), but as (I hope) the project grows, more features will be added in to allow the system to function as a complete replacement for the currently expensive options out in the private marketplace.
