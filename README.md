# TaxFormEFile
A .NET Standard library to encapsulate generating IRS e-filing document creation

## Vision
The vision for this project is to take [IRS Publication 1220](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1220.pdf) and with it, generate a .NET Standard Library which will encapsulate all of the logic necessary to generate an appropriately formatted e-file document which can be sent to the IRS at tax time.
